# `carbon-custom-elements`

`carbon-custom-elements` is a variant of Carbon Design System with Custom Elements v1 and Shadow DOM v1 specs.

Experimental at this moment, with enthusiasm.

The effort stems from https://github.com/carbon-design-system/issue-tracking/issues/121. If you are interested in this project, adding 👍 to the description of that GH issue, or even contributing, will be greatly appreciated!

## Getting started with development

1. Fork this repository and clone it
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn storybook`

## Running React/Angular demo

- React: `yarn storybook:react`
- Angular: `yarn storybook:angular`

## List of available components

View available web components at: https://carbon-custom-elements.netlify.com/. You can see usage information in several ways:

1. Clicking the **KNOBS** tab at the bottom and changing values there. Most knobs are shown as something like `Button kind (kind)`, where `kind` is the attribute name
2. Clicking the **ACTION LOGGER** tab at the bottom and interacting with the selected component. You may see something like `bx-modal-closed` which typically indicates that an event with such event type is fired. You can also expand the twistie to see the details of the event

## Browser support

- Latest Chrome/Safari/FF ESR
- IE/Edge support is bast-effort basis
  - Some components may not be supported

## Coding conventions

Can be found at [here](./src/coding-conventions.md).

## Iteration plans

- [i1 (July 2019)](./plans/i1.md)
- [i2 (August 2019)](./plans/i2.md)
- [i3 (September 2019)](./plans/i3.md)

## Creating build

(Only per-module ESM build is available as of now)

```
> gulp clean
> gulp build:modules
```

You'll see the build artifacts in `/path/to/carbon-custom-elements/es` directory.

## Running unit test

You can run unit test by:

```
> gulp test:unit
```

You can run specific test spec by:

```
> gulp test:unit -s tests/spec/dropdown_spec.ts
```

You can choose a browser (instead of Headless Chrome) by:

```
> gulp test:unit -b Firefox
```

You can keep the browser after the test (and re-run the test when files change) by:

```
> gulp test:unit -b Chrome -k
```

You can prevent code coverate instrumentation code from being generated by:

```
> gulp test:unit -d
```

Above options can be used together. This is useful to debug your code as you test:

```
> gulp test:unit -s tests/spec/dropdown_spec.ts -b Chrome -d -k
```
